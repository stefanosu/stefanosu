### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**stefanosu/stefanosu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi my name is Stefanos Ugbit. I'm a software engineer from The Bronx, NY. I like to read and write poetry. Found my passion for programming while studying Economics and conducting policy research during my college education and realized that most of the interesting and dynamic solutions to complex problems were produced by technologists, not economists. I'm passionate about open source software it has gave me a good start in tech and has introduced me into projects that I like contributing to. I like to write some blog posts and will continue to do more at https://medium.com/@stefanosu422
